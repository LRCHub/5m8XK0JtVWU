I confess I saw her in a sun dress
Her congress is nothing more than process
Meant too I didn't mean to kill you
Shot through I'll make your patrons thank you

So I'm aligning my soul on a Saturday
I always thought of a banter in its own weight
Lalalalalalalala media your killing me
Killing me, killing me, killing me now
So I'm aligning my soul on a Saturday
I always thought of a banter in its own weight
Lalalalalalalala media your killing me
Killing me, killing me, killing me now

Muddy water I see you in the blue sky
Fly by it makes her change look nice
Beer can, another chance to spill job
Come fast and growing in your new chairs

So I'm aligning my soul on a Saturday
I always thought of a banter in its own weight
Lalalalalalalala media your killing me
Killing me, killing me, killing me now
So I'm aligning my soul on a Saturday
I always thought of a banter in its own weight
Lalalalalalalala media your killing me
Killing me, killing me, killing me now
So I'm aligning my soul on a Saturday
I always thought of a banter in its own weight
Lalalalalalalala media your killing me
Killing me, killing me, killing me now
So I'm aligning my soul on a Saturday
I always thought of a banter in its own weight
Lalalalalalalala media your killing me
Killing me, killing me, killing me now

I confess I saw her in a sun dress
