I don't know what that is
And
I don't know what that is
The feeling jumping up and down in my head
The clicking noise inside my head
I don't know what that is
And
I don't know what that is
The pressure pumping up and down in my heart
The supersonic beat in my heart
こんがらがったイヤホンケーブルみたいな情報網
知りたくもない
触れたくもない
ご勝手に断線しちゃって
情報が錯綜し
何も信じられない時代こそ
騙されるな
騙してやれ
I don't believe in you
I think my soul is blind
A will inside my pain
Yeah my soul is blind
That's why I am not scared
I think my soul is blind
There's a will inside my pain
Yeah my soul is blind
That's why I am not
I don't know what that is
And
I don't know what that is
The feeling jumping up and down in my head
The clicking noise inside my head
I don't know what that is
And
I don't know what that is
The pressure pumping up and down in my heart
The supersonic beat in my heart
こんがらがったpubic(hair)みたいな人間関係に
関係無い赤い他人が首を突っ込んでは
関係者ぶってる
状況は最悪で
何もかも失敗した時こそ
化かされるな
化かしてやれ

A will inside my pain
Yeah my soul is blind
That's why I am not scared
I think my soul is blind
There's a will inside my pain
Yeah my soul is blind
That's why I am not
I don't believe in fairytales
I don't need to go to your seminar
You say I'm wrong but I am right
For those reasons I have lost all of my fear
Sky is falling down
Oceans floating into space
Could be a chance to win a lottery today

I can fly I can fly I can fly
